# In-Class-Sandbox

Here, I am learning about git as my version control system.

The `READ.md file is a markdown file where I can share important notes about my code repository

I can create **bold** (wrapped by two asterisks) or *italics* (wrapped by one asterisk).

I can create fenced code blocks using back-ticks like this:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
}
```

I am learning about

- Creating a git repository (online, and on my computer)
- Synchronizing my git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
